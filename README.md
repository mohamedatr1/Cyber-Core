# 🛡️ Cyber-Core: Security Fundamentals Lab

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journey! This repository is a central hub for my Python scripts, focused on automating security tasks and understanding the basics of pentesting.

## 🚀 What's Inside?
I am documenting my progress through various modules:

* **🔍 Reconnaissance:** Scripts for IP scanning, DNS resolution, and information gathering.
* **🌐 Web Security:** Tools for interacting with APIs, web scraping, and identifying website technologies.
* **🐍 Python Automation:** Scripts that simplify manual tasks using libraries like `requests` and `socket`.
* **🧪 Vulnerability Basics:** Early-stage scripts for understanding SQL injection and brute-force mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `socket`, `beautifulsoup4`, `os`, `sys`.
* **Environment:** VS Code on Windows/Linux.

## 📈 My Goals
- [ ] Master Python for Network Security.
- [ ] Understand OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Build a complete automated reconnaissance framework.
